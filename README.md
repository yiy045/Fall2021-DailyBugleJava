# Fall2021-DailyBugleJava

This was a project back in my Fall 2021 Semester, in my Application Programming class, where we had to use JavaFX and Scenebuilder in order to mimic a Daily Bugle "newspaper". We had to have 3 pages: a home page, a classifieds page, and a crossword page. The classified page had to read data from "ads.csv" and put that data onto various labels on the page. The crossword page was supposed to take data from "across.csv" and "down.csv" and check to see if the user put the correct answers.
